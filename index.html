				<p>Have you ever wished you had the perfect pair of scissors for fabric cutting? Blades that don't get gummy, handles that don't feel like lead in your hands, and something that cuts with the same ease and delicacy of a rotary blade? Your time has come! The Perfect Shears are just what they sound like--perfect! &#128516; They can cut through any fabric or textile like butter. When you hold them, the handles seem to melt into your palm. You can use them to make cuts with a fraction-of-a-centimeter's precision, but without all the headache.</p>

				<p>Not only do they function well, they look beautiful. You can purchase the standard right-handed variety...</p>
				<p>...Or, for our long-suffering lefties, a left-handed version is avalable, too! And because we take our goal of eliminating ability-based discrimination very seriously, you won't see a mark-up in price for this inclusive product.</p>
